## [Written Review](services/written-review)

I will write a professional review of your plugin, theme, or product here on the site.  This is a user-based review on how well your product performs or does whatever it is supposed to do.  [See service details &rarr;](services/written-review)

## [Code Review](services/code-review)

I will perform a private code or design audit of your WordPress theme or plugin.  This may include anything from security holes to making sure that you're following coding standards.  [See service details &rarr;](services/code-review)

## [Plugin Build](services/plugin-build)

I will build a plugin based on whatever feature you have a need for using standards-compliant code.  I generally only take smaller jobs due to time constraints.  [See service details &rarr;](services/plugin-build)
