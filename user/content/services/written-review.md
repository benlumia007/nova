title : "Written Review"
---

If you have a WordPress theme or plugin that you want professionally reviewed, you've come to the right place.  Here's what you'll get with my service.

- Full review from a user perspective.
- The review will be publicly placed on my blog.
- At least 1,000 words to cover all aspects of the theme/plugin.
- I'll link to the review on my social media accounts (over 14K Twitter followers).

One of the best reasons to have your project reviewed on my blog is that I pull in quality traffic from other WordPress professionals who will take note of your work.  The backlinks alone are worth the price of a review. [View previous reviews.](topics/wordpress-reviews)

I don't write B.S. or fluff pieces.  I call 'em like I see 'em.  If your project is a dumpster fire, I'm going to say it's a dumpster fire.  That's how I roll.

If you're interested in such a review, shoot me an email at <justintadlock@gmail.com>.  Serious inquiries only.  Minimum review price begins at $350 and depends on the size of the project.

## Qualifications

You need to trust that I'm qualified to write your review.  I get it.  Below is an outline of my qualifications for the job.

### WordPress

I've been working with WordPress since 2005 (and general Web design since 2003).  In 2008, I launched [Theme Hybrid](https://themehybrid.com), one of the oldest and longest-running theme/plugin clubs in existence.

I was a team lead/admin for the official WordPress [theme review team](https://make.wordpress.org/themes) for several years and still volunteer as a moderator.  I also professionally review theme/plugin code at [ThemeReview.co](http://themereview.co).

Some other interesting tid-bits:

- I co-wrote [Professional WordPress Plugin Development](plugindevbook).
- I've written 100s of [WordPress tutorials](topics/wordpress-tutorials).
- I maintain [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members), a plugin with 100,000+ active installations.
- I've built 100s of plugins and themes over the years for public release and clients.

I've been around the block a few times.

### Writing

Unlike many programmers and other tech writers, I actually have formal training in writing.  You won't see a metric ton of misspelled words.  You won't get a new paragraph with each sentence.  In other words, the review won't look like it's written by a 5th grader dumping words onto the screen so they can get back to playing _Fortnite_.

I attended [Auburn University](http://auburn.edu/), one of the top universities in the southeast U.S., from 2002-2007.  During my tenure, I earned a B.A. in English with a concentration in creative writing and journalism.  This was after growing bored with the software engineering program (funny that I ended up becoming a programmer).  While there, I also helped a local high school launch a student-run newspaper.

Some other interesting writing accomplishments:

- I taught English as a second language in South Korea.
- I co-authored _[Professional WordPress Plugin Development](plugindevbook)_.
- I rocked National Novel Writing Month in [2018](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2018/12/01/nanowrimo-2018-and-beyond).
