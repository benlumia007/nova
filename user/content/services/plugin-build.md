title : "Plugin Build"
---

If you need a custom plugin built for your site, let me take a look at the project and see what we can do.  If we decide to work together, here's what you'll get.

- Plugin coded to modern PHP standards.
- Access/control of the code repository (if you want it).
- A final ZIP file with the completed plugin for installation.

Shoot me an email at <justintadlock@gmail.com> with your project proposal.  Serious inquiries only. Prices are based per job.

<p class="message">
I generally only take on small projects due to time constraints.  Also, I only write code that works on PHP 5.6+ (preferably 7+) and do not support old and outdated versions of PHP.

## Qualifications

I've been working with WordPress since 2005 (and general Web design since 2003).  In 2008, I launched [Theme Hybrid](https://themehybrid.com), one of the oldest and longest-running theme/plugin clubs in existence.

I was a team lead/admin for the official WordPress [theme review team](https://make.wordpress.org/themes) for several years and still volunteer as a moderator.  I also professionally review theme/plugin code at [ThemeReview.co](http://themereview.co).

Some other interesting tid-bits:

- I co-wrote [Professional WordPress Plugin Development](plugindevbook).
- I've written 100s of [WordPress tutorials](topics/wordpress-tutorials).
- I maintain [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members), a plugin with 100,000+ active installations.
- I've built 100s of plugins and themes over the years for public release and clients.
