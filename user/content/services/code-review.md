title : "Code Review"
---

I've reviewed 100s of WordPress plugins and themes over the years and helped numerous developers create better products as a result.

My focus is on making sure that your project is coded to standards and follows best practices when it comes to security.  However, I also look at the user experience and offer advice on improvements where necessary.  Here's what you'll get with my service:

- Full code audit.
- Issues posted on your GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab repo's issue tracker.
- Q&A period after the review if you need help understanding any issue.

If you're interested in such a review, shoot me an email at <justintadlock@gmail.com>.  Serious inquiries only.  Minimum review price begins at $250 and depends on the size of the project.  I'm also available to do design-only reviews as well.

## Qualifications

I've been working with WordPress since 2005 (and general Web design since 2003).  In 2008, I launched [Theme Hybrid](https://themehybrid.com), one of the oldest and longest-running theme/plugin clubs in existence.

I was a team lead/admin for the official WordPress [theme review team](https://make.wordpress.org/themes) for several years and still volunteer as a moderator.  I also professionally review theme/plugin code at [ThemeReview.co](http://themereview.co).

Some other interesting tid-bits:

- I co-wrote [Professional WordPress Plugin Development](plugindevbook).
- I've written 100s of [WordPress tutorials](topics/wordpress-tutorials).
- I maintain [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members), a plugin with 100,000+ active installations.
- I've built 100s of plugins and themes over the years for public release and clients.
