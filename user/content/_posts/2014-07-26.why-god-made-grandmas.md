Because of a <a href="https://twitter.com/justintadlock/status/493016546097106944">Twitter conversation</a> this morning, I had a hankering for some good ol' Southern biscuits.  And, like everyone knows, no one does it better than Granny (a common name for Southern grandmas).  I told Granny if she'd make some, I'd eat breakfast with her.

What made this even better is that she had leftover gravy from mashed potatoes last night.
