I'm unofficially naming this strain of watermelon the "Big Papa Yellow" after my grandfather.  He gave me these giant-producing watermelon seeds this year that he's been saving over time.

Since this was the biggest watermelon I've grown this year, I decided it was only right that I let my Papa and Granny get a taste of this one.  Of course, we had enough for the entire family and then some.  Not only did we have some good eatin', I saved about 200 seeds for next year and got 2.5 gallons worth of rind to make watermelon rind preserves.

_Please ignore the unshaven, unkempt me in the photo above and focus on the size of the melon.  When I get to looking that scruffy, it means I've been working a lot._
