My cousin was in town today.  As is custom, that meant riding up to Prattville, Ala. and stopping by Bass Pro Shops.  We had a pretty fun day hanging out.  We took Shannon's son out for lunch at Steak &lsquo;n Shake (yes, I brought home an extra burger).

We started the day letting Shannon meet my niece (pictured below with my sister) and ended the day with me buying a Buffy the Vampire Slayer toy.

_Hey, don't judge me. It was $5 and the Books-a-Million woman went totally out the way to find it for us when we were joking about them needing a Buffy in the collection. She (the woman, not the toy) was cute in the geeky kind of way that I like and easily took my money.  I'm such a sucker._

Anyway, here's a few photos to commemorate the day.
