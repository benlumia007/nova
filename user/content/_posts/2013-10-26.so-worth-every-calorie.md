excerpt   : "A new experiment in the kitchen with homemade cinnamon rolls and some other goodies."
---

My dad keeps talking about this recipe he uses that is supposed to replicate the world-famous Cinnabon cinnamon roll.  I've never had one of their cinnamon rolls, so I have nothing to compare the end result against.  I just know that I'm a bad-ass in the kitchen and these things were awesome.

Not only did I make cinnamon rolls for the first time, I also threw together a few staples in my house while waiting around.

I need to start a recipe blog.
