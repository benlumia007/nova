It's that time of the year again. A new TV season is upon us. With some shows beginning to air this week, I thought it best to post my "to watch" schedule for the fall.

Unlike [last year](/archives/2018/09/24/2018-2019-network-tv-schedule), I've pared my list down to a handful of shows.  One reason for this change is that I'm working nights for the next few months on a project that I haven't officially announced, so I simply have fewer hours.  Another big part of it is that I was [disappointed in so much this past season](/archives/2019/06/30/2018-2019-network-tv-review).  I want to spend more of my free time on things that I'm truly enjoying.

I'm also getting back into movie collecting to a small degree.  I'm not buying everything that comes out like I did at one point in the past.  However, I am picking up things that make me happy or that I'm super excited about.
