While everyone was celebrating Thanksgiving this past week, my oldest cat, Smeagle, was celebrating his 13th birthday. He wasn't particularly fond of the camera. The above shots were the best I could get him to pose for in the last few days.

Yes, Smeagle is named after the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> character (thank you, Tim). He's a grumpy surrogate grandpa to 4 younger cats -- Jane and Oreo are also pictured above.  He is a great companion and has never met a human stranger.
