excerpt   : "Pictures from my trip to the Korean folk village."
---

My vacation is finally over, and I'm trying to get back into the swing of things.  As <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/06/02/ill-be-on-vacation#comment-12104" title="Comment from Sueli Brodin"> requested</a>, here are some photos.

These are from the Korean Folk Village.  Unfortunately, for quite a few days, it rained, and I didn't get to take as many pictures as I wanted.
