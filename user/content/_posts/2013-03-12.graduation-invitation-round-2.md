A few weeks ago, I showed you the <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/02/20/graduation-invitation-round-1" title="Graduation invitation: Round #1">first round</a> of design ideas for my brother's graduation invitations.  We decided on the third design, which no one seemed to favor.  Granted, I didn't have a good photo to work with at the time, so it wasn't my favorite either.  The above is a view of the original versus the current draft of what I have in mind for the invitation.
