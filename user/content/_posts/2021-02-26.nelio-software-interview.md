Ruth Ravent√≥s interviewed me for Nelio Software's [WordPress professional of the month](https://neliosoftware.com/blog/justin-tadlock-wprofessional-of-the-month/) series.  We covered my work at WP Tavern, [Pro WP Plugin Dev](/plugindevbook), the future of WordPress, writing, reading, and my cats.

One thing I didn't add is that taking a full-time job at the Tavern has given me a bit more structure. When running Theme Hybrid, my life revolved around the business. There was no balance. I needed to step away from that situation. Today, I can mostly shut off my online life at night or on the weekends, and there is something freeing about that.
