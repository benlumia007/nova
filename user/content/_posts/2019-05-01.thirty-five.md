Every year I tell myself that I'm going to _blog my birthday_.  And, every May 1st, with the exception of a [bacon omelet photo](/archives/2012/05/01/birthday-breakfast-of-champions) I posted in 2013, I fail.

This year, I was determined.

The fates were absolutely working against me today.  I was coding a new feature for my [Exhale WordPress theme](https://themehybrid.com/themes/exhale) that I thought would be finished by lunch.  But, I missed that mark by a few hours.

Still, I was determined to sit down and write this post.  And, here we are.

It's been a solid year for me so far.  Last month, I released the Exhale theme, which has dominated much of my working hours.  I rebranded and refocused [Theme Hybrid](https://themehybrid.com).  These were some of my big work-related goals for the year, and I'm happy to have them done within the first half of the year.

As for my personal life...

## 2019 goal updates

Since my birthday is in May, I thought it'd make for a good time to look over and evaluate some of the [goals I set for the year](/archives/2019/01/01/2019-goals).

### Writing

I'm woefully behind on my writing goals thus far.  I done well in January and February with tinkering on a couple of novel ideas.  But, I haven't found a good balance between other creative pursuits and writing.  I need to do better.

### Reading

I'm doing great with my reading goals.  I've read 12 of 40 books for my [2019 reading challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/14775830) on Goodreads, and I'm working on #13.  I'd probably be a bit further ahead, but most of what I've been reading has been epic fantasy.  I'll still be on track for the year once I pick up a few shorter works to balance things out.

Some reading stats thus far ([Goodreads stats](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/90151529)):

- 12 books
- 6,897 pages
- Shortest book: 192 pages
- Longest book: 1,178 pages
- Average length: 582 pages

### Watch less TV

I've definitely cut back in this area.  Just keeping up with my reading has made this a reality.  I've also saved over $100 this year by canceling both Netflix and YouTube Premium.

One thing I done was cut out a few shows that I began watching in the fall.  I hate quitting things once I've started, but some series were just not that interesting to me anymore.

### Tidying

I had a good stretch of tidying earlier in the year.  I accomplished many of the big tasks like organizing clothes, books, and movies.  I still have a lot of miscellaneous areas to cover.

I got a little behind recently because my grandmother wanted her kitchen and dining rooms tidied.  It took us four Sunday afternoons to do it (time I would've been tidying my own stuff).  But, I'm glad I got a chance to help her with it because it kick-started her journey into other areas of her house.

### Bullet journaling

This has been hit or miss for me.  I enjoy the process, and it definitely helps me organize work/life better...when I do it.  I still haven't built up a good habit with this.

### Gardening

I'm nearly perfectly on track here.  I cut way back this year so that I could focus more on work and other pursuits.  My primary crop of potatoes is looking great.  I should harvest them within the next month or so.

Outside of potatoes, I just have a few beds with a mix of veggies.

### Finances

I feel like I've been doing better here.  I've saved back a small bit.  My big goal was not to buy a lot of new stuff.

The two "big" purchases I've made have been a couple of new sheet sets for the bed.  It's been years since I got new sheets, and dropping a few extra dollars for a couple of quality sets was well worth it.

I finally maxed out my $100 Amazon gift card from Christmas.  I only bought books with it, so that's helped me save a few of my own dollars.
