I finally updated the [_Professional WordPress Plugin Development_](/plugindevbook) book page for the 2nd edition today.  Yeah, it is a few months later than I expected, but at least it is done now.  As always, it is a work in progress.

If you're feeling nostalgic, you can check out the archived [1e book page](/plugindevbook/1e).
