As I look back on the [past year](/archives/2020/12/31/2020-counting-my-blessings), it is hard to believe everything that happened.  I am a proud owner of a [new home](/archives/2020/12/30/two-car-garage-no-white-picket-fence) that sits on 2.5 acres of land.  I have worked as a full-time writer at WP Tavern for over a year.  Plus, so many other great things took place in 2020.

But, now it is time to start looking ahead at the new year.

Every January 1st, I lay out my goals for the upcoming 12 months.  With a new home, it is nearly overwhelming to think about each of those goals.  There is so much to do -- years of work.  It is hard to say what I will get done this year.  So, on the home front, I do not want to set out any specific goals.  I need to just take this one day at a time right now.  Plus, I have only lived at this place for a month now.  I haven't had time to adjust and map out clearer steps for the short term.  I have some large, overarching long-term ideas, but the more immediate needs change rapidly.

Like [last year](/archives/2020/01/01/2020-goals), I want to limit my goals to the big-ticket items.  For everything else, it's too early to set any plans in stone.

## Writing

After failing to produce a novel manuscript last year, this is one of my top goals for 2020.  Sure, I co-authored and published the second edition of [Professional WordPress Plugin Development](/plugindevbook) in 2019, but that was not the major writing goal I had for myself.  This year, I must put serious work into becoming a novelist.

For complete transparency, I am not currently in the right mindset to take on this venture.  I know for certain that it will be at least a month or two before I can start to put together a plan of action.  This is simply because I have so much going on with moving into my new home.  I haven't even come close to finishing the unpacking process.

Yes, it sounds like I am already making excuses for not working on my novel.  However, that is not the case.  I just know the reality of my situation and what I can do in the timeframe that I have.

If March rolls around and I am not at least outlining something, then we have a problem.

## Reading

Like the past couple of years, I plan to continue reading every day.  On December 3, 2020, I hit the two-year mark of my personal daily reading challenge.  I have no plans of stopping this.  By the time I write this post next year, I will have read something each day for over three years straight.

I want to take this goal an extra step and make it a lifelong commitment.  From here on out, my goal is to read every day until the day that I die.

I will probably stick with epic fantasy this year for the most part.  That is my bread and butter.  Currently, I am on the fourth book of _The Stormlight Archive_, _Rhythm of War_, by Brandon Sanderson.

I would also like to branch out a bit more.  I don't have any specific books on my list beyond the current novel that I am reading.  So, let's just see what the future holds.

Once again, I am aiming for 30 books for 2020.

## Here's to a New Year

Mostly, I plan to stay on course with the things I set out to do last year.  I honestly don't yearn for too much to change in 2021.  I just want to stay on track with my big reading and writing goals, continue being smart financially, and settle into my new home.

I will probably do a small bit of gardening.  I will continue building my physical media collection as part of a lifelong goal I laid out last year.  I will definitely pet multiple cats each day -- I have six living in the house with me now.

But, the big goal for 2021 is to just enjoy life and make the most of each day.
