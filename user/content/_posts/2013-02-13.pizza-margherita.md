I took a break from my vegan diet for one night and went vegetarian. I wanted to try my hand at a more traditional Pizza Margherita (well, as close as I can get with the ingredients at hand).  It's about as simple at it gets, but when it comes to pizza, the quality of the ingredients is worth much more than quantity.
