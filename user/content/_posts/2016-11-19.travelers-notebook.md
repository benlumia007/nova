Some pics of my new traveler's notebook.  This is not the famous [Midori Traveler's Notebook](https://www.amazon.com/Travelers-Notebook-Brown-Leather-LB/dp/B000ZYF22M/?tag=justtadl-20), which was bit pricey for my first TN.  Instead, I went with a [cheaper handmade journal](https://www.amazon.com/Handmade-Refillable-Travelers-Journals-notebook/dp/B014EPHH52/?tag=justtadl-20) at about half the price.  This notebook will hold Midori regular-sized inserts/refills though.

This version came with 3 inserts (blank/sketch, grid, and lined), a pen clip, and a card holder + zipped case insert.  I like it so far.
