I wanted to take a quick stroll this morning as the sun was rising to take pictures.  Unfortunately, I forgot to charge my camera and missed the early dawn.  So, instead of the post "South Korean Sunrise," which is kind of catchy, you only get "South Korean Morning."

I have the day off since it's Children's day out here in Korea.  It was nice to just get up and take a walk this morning though.  Here's a few pictures from the area I live in.

I might make this gallery thing a more permanent feature here on the blog.  I haven't decided whether to make it a post or static page thing yet.  Mostly, I need to start sharing some pictures with the family.

Let me know what you think.
