As this year's spring season gets underway, I've already gotten the garden fever.  That's just a given for me after waiting and planning all winter.  Here's a look at some of the homestead so far this year.

I've got a few other things planted that I hope to show in the coming months.  There's still lots to do for this year's gardening season.

I wasn't planning on all the cat pics, but they wanted their pictures taken this morning. ;) Cats do play a vital role on any size farm by keeping critters away from your precious veggies.
