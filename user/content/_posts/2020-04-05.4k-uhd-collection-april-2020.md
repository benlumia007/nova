![Over 80 4K UHD movies in a box.](/user/media/2020/04/4k-collection.jpg){.alignwide}

I am back in the collecting game.  After several months of work and keeping an eye on deals, I am now inching closer toward 100 titles and have built a pretty nice 4K UHD collection.

It started with my first DVD player in 2001.  Since then, I have amassed a large collection of movies and TV series on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K UHD.  I even have a few VHS tapes and Laserdiscs for that matter.  But, today is about the 4K collection.

Of course, I am rocking several Marvel and Disney movies, which are about half of the collection.  The other half is an assortment of titles I enjoy, some blind buys, and guilty pleasures.  At the top, I have a few steelbooks (_The Last Jedi_, _The Rise of Skywalker_, and _Captain Marvel_).

Presented in no particular order, the best movies in this collection that I currently recommend watching are:

- Nezha
- Abominable
- Rocketman
- Ford v Ferrari
- Baby Driver
- Zootopia
- Moana
- Life of Pi
- Once Upon a Time in Hollywood
- Joker

The following are some of my guilty pleasures:

- Power Rangers
- Moana
- Alita
- Aladdin (live action)

These were completely blind buys that turned out to be surprisingly awesome:

- Nezha
- Brightburn
- Shazam!

I didn't really add Marvel films to my above lists because I consider those films sacred.  Well, maybe not _The Incredible Hulk_.  My favorites in the MCU are the Guardians and Spider-Man films.  But, _Captain America: Civil War_ is one of the best.

And, yes, I have two copies of _Power Rangers_.  Amazon sent two instead of one.  It's _really_ not because I am that big of a fan.
