Last year, I began the [process of starting a blackberry wine](/archives/2017/05/06/blackberry-wine-getting-started).  Just before Christmas, I was able to bottle it and give most of it away as gifts.  Of course, I kept a bottle of it for myself.  It got pretty good reviews for my second go at wine making.

I just wanted to share the final update for those of you who have followed this story from the beginning.  Here's a quick gallery of how everything turned out from start to finish.
