What a ride.

I began my _Mistborn_ journey at the end of this past December.  In its [review](/archives/2019/01/02/mistborn-the-final-empire) gave the first book credit for getting me back into the habit of turning the page rather than turning the channel.  Now that I've finished the final book in the trilogy, _[The Hero of Ages](https://www.amazon.com/Hero-Ages-Book-Three-Mistborn-ebook/dp/B002LC8HF0/?tag=justtadl-20)_, I'm a bit sad to see it end.

Yes, there are other _Mistborn_ books for me to explore, but those take place in a different era with a different cast.

I'm finding it hard to let go of Vinn, Sazed, Eland, and the others.  Especially Vinn.  Even after three books and some of my dislike of the teen angst in the second, she's still one of my favorite kick-ass heroines of all time.

What I love about Brandon Sanderson's work is his imagination.  Or, rather, how he brings what he imagines to life on the page.  A lot of people talk about world building in writer circles these days but often forget about plot and character development in those discussions.  What Sanderson does is bring you into this vivid (or, in this case, dark and ashen) world through the eyes of his characters and the story.  You can feel the ash fall as a battle comes upon the crew or the pushes and pulls of allomantic powers as they're used.

_The Hero of Ages_ finally answered some of the major questions I've had.  Sanderson tied a ton of loose ends up into a neatly-structured story with a whirlwind of an ending.  I was most interested in the storyline of the Kandra.  In the third book, we finally got some answers about these mysterious beings as we followed TenSoon's journey.

I won't talk much about the plot.  If you're this far into the series, you owe it to yourself to continue reading.

There are many authors with far more beautiful prose than Sanderson, but he's continually improving.  At times, there are a few words that seem out of place and others that are overused.  They're rarely a distraction from the story.  I look forward to many more years of reading his work (I'm currently enjoying _The Way of Kings_).  I'm sure I'll return to the world of _Mistborn_ in the future.

It's been over a month since I put this book down and am still coming down from the high.  That ending was amazing.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5 stars - _The Hero of Ages_.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5 stars - _Mistborn Trilogy_.
